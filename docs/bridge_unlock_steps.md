title:  Unlock Funds on Godwoken
---


## Unlock Workflow

Withdrawing funds from Godwoken is a two-step process. Step one initiates the withdrawal and step two releases the funds. A five-day dispute period will begin once the withdrawal process has commenced. To complete the withdrawal process, the `unlock` command must be executed. To unlock the withdrawal cells to normal ckb cells and to perform common Layer2 actions, the [`account-cli tool`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken-examples/tree/develop/packages/tools) will be needed. 

### Steps

1. Execute the Unlock Command
